# Welcome

I have no idea where to start, even less idea why I am starting at all. Historically recording my thoughts online has had ... repercussions. I am not entirely sure how much of those were in my own head or if any were real because no one would tell me that they were subscribing (stalking) to my content (me.) I started publishing poetry and opinions online in the early 1990's while in college. I made interactive 'art' and hosted it on our free student accounts, publicly available on the internet, my first personal website. I always held a libertarian belief in freedom and to be 'online' was a form of personal sovereignty. Wether or not I should, I was allowed to be vulnerable and open, sharing personal art and public social opinions that all linked back to me, a person.

I always had a crazy idea that I might someday tell stories, or entertain people using an app or website that I would create. I still have this feeling and yet I still have not made this entertaining thing. I have every opportunity to do so. There are a lot of excuses for why I haven't. I would rather look ahead and create a vision out of basis while I still have something inside urging me to do it.
